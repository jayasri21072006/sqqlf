-- =============================

-- Question 1:
-- Create a table called employees with specific constraints.
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000
);

-- Question 2:
-- Explain the purpose of constraints.
-- Constraints help maintain data integrity. Types include:
-- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.

-- Question 3:
-- Why NOT NULL and can PRIMARY KEY have NULL?
-- NOT NULL ensures values are mandatory.
-- PRIMARY KEY can never have NULLs because it uniquely identifies rows.

-- Question 4:
-- Add/Remove constraints on an existing table.
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);
ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT unique_email;

-- Question 5:
-- Example of constraint violation:
-- INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, age, email) VALUES (1, 'Tom', 15, 'tom@example.com');
-- ERROR: age check constraint violated.

-- Question 6:
-- Add primary key and default to products table.
ALTER TABLE products ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

-- Question 7:
-- INNER JOIN to fetch student_name and class_name.
SELECT student_name, class_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN classes ON students.class_id = classes.class_id;

-- Question 8:
-- LEFT JOIN to show all products even without orders.
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- Question 9:
-- Total sales amount per product using SUM.
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

-- Question 10:
-- INNER JOIN across 3 tables for order_id, customer_name, quantity.
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, oi.quantity
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),

-- Q2: Explain the purpose of constraints
-- Constraints maintain data integrity.
-- Examples: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT

-- Q3: Why use NOT NULL and can primary key have NULL?
-- NOT NULL makes sure a value is present.
-- PRIMARY KEY cannot be NULL since it uniquely identifies records.

ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT email_unique UNIQUE(email);
ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT email_unique;

-- Q5: Example of constraint violation
-- INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, age, email) VALUES (1, 'Tom', 15, 'tom@example.com');
